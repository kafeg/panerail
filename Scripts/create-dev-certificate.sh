# Creates a self-signed code-signing certificate for local development.
#
# Why: macOS ties an Accessibility grant to the app's code signature. Ad-hoc
# signing produces a different identity on every build, so the permission has
# to be granted again after each rebuild. Signing with one stable certificate
# keeps the grant.
#
# The certificate stays on this machine and is used for local builds only;
# releases are signed separately. Remove it any time with:
#   security delete-certificate -c "PaneRail Dev" ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
